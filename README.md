# Reason for the project: 
  This project was built in order to apply and showcase the skills I have learned and developed throughout my program at the Software Engineering Live class - FlatIron Bootcamp (class of 09/21). These skills major in our ability  

# Project Description: 
  Social4SocialPeople is a social media platform in which people can make a profile that includes a email, username, bio, as well as a secure password and uploading a photo. Other functions are login, logout, and maintain a login session utilizing cookies in the brower. Users can edit their bio, follow and unfollow other users. When logged in, users can view and like other's posts and create posts to share with their followers. Users are also able to search for other's in the search page. 

# Learnings and Struggles:
  As a team, we struggled with the idea of a self-referential table. To have the feature of following/followers, we needed to create an additional relationship between users that accurately protrays who is following who. This relationship included foreign keys of both a followed_id and following_id that ties back to the user table. However, this one concept is tied back to most every other aspect of the project including posts, users data, ect. Overall, we are proud to have accomplished a project that including a self referential table. 

# Acknowledgments:

The Queen of Potatoes (aka - Emiley Palmquist) was a cornerstone aspect of this project, she helped offer resources and advice as the project progressed.
