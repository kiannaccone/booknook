# Reason for the project:

This project was built in order to apply and showcase the skills I have learned and developed throughout my program at the Software Engineering Live class - FlatIron Bootcamp (class of 09/21). These skills major in my use of Rails to build and create relationships between the GoogleBooks API backend database, utilized React for the fontend, and used HTML and CSS to design the webpages.

# Project Description:

BookNook is an online platform that allows users to connect and discuss their favorite books. The users can make a profile that includes a email, username, as well as a secure password and upload an avatar of their choosing. Other functions are login, logout, and maintain a login session utilizing cookies in the brower. When logged in, users can search for books by title or author, view the books information, and can start discussion topics on a book and comments can be left on the disussion topics.

# Learnings and Struggles:

Learning and planning out the polymorphic relationship tables for the discussion and comment relationship was a challenge. This relationship included foreign keys of both a commentable_type and commentable_id that ties back to the post/discussion table. Additionally, I worked with the GoogleBooks API. It was my first time working with an API and figuring out the documention and how to access data that was nested deeply was challenging, especially because the API is tied to the whole project. Overall, I are proud to have accomplished a project that included a API a polymorphic table.

# Acknowledgments:

I used numerous resources both from the curriculum, those available for free online, and advice from my instructor Emiley Palmquist. These allowed me to expand my knowledge and practice many new skills.
